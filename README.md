# Score Keeper

My first humble JS app made solely for practice and future progress monitoring.
Preview here: [https://pansrokaofficial.github.io/](https://pansrokaofficial.github.io/)

## Features

 - Selectable sport icon
 - Editable player names
 - Confetti effect on win
 - Reset link behaviour iterates when ctrl or âŒ˜ held down (on desktop)

## To fix

 - Select component styling (dropdown arrow)
 - OS detection (iPhone/iPad currently detected as desktop Mac)
